                        <p>
                            Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience,
                            strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to
                            recover from alcoholism.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for
                            A.A. membership; we are self supporting through our own contributions.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not
                            wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose
                            is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
                        </p>
